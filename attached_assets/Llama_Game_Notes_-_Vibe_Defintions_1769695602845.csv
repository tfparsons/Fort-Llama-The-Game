Core calculations,OverallLevel,(LS × PR × PT)^(1/3),Feeds tier selection
Core calculations,Spread,"max(LS, PR, PT) − min(LS, PR, PT)",Feeds balance and branch selection
Balance state,Balanced,Spread ≤ 0.18,Output format; TierName
Balance state,Unbalanced; Mild,0.18 < Spread ≤ 0.30,Output format; TierName; BranchLabel (mild)

Branch driver selection,Median,"Middle value of {LS, PR, PT}",Used to compare deltas
Branch driver selection,HighDelta,max − Median,Candidate driver
Branch driver selection,LowDelta,Median − min,Candidate driver
Branch driver selection,Driver pick,If HighDelta ≥ LowDelta; driver is “high metric” (the max); else driver is “low metric” (the min),Determines which branch dictionary to use
