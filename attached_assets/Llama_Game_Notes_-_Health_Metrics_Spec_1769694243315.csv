Living Standards (LS),"“Is the house pleasant, functional, and worth paying for?” Comfort, hygiene, basic quality-of-life.",Baseline: Nutrition; Cleanliness. Dampeners: Crowding Pressure (high reduces); Maintenance Backlog (high reduces).,Baseline × dampeners (multiplicative): \nLS = (Nutrition^wN × Cleanliness^wC) × ((1 − Crowding Pressure)^wCP) × ((1 − Maintenance Backlog)^wMB) \nStarter weights; wN 0.5; wC 0.5; wCP 0.35; wMB 0.35,"Multiplicative dampening stops “compensation exploits”; players can’t brute-force one strong primitive to mask a structurally bad house. \nExponents as weights give you a single, intuitive tuning surface; raising a weight increases sensitivity to that factor without changing the overall shape. \nClamp to 0–1 at each stage keeps the metric stable; prevents edge cases from blowing up outcomes.","Rent tolerance: LS sets how much rent you can charge “safely”. \nrentTolerance = baseRent × (1 + rentScaleLS × LS) \nOver-rent pressure: overRent = max(0, (rent − rentTolerance) / rentTolerance) \nChurn: LS reduces churn directly; and reduces churn indirectly by raising rentTolerance. \nchurnMultiplierLS = lerp(hiChurnLS, loChurnLS, LS) (example hi 1.6; lo 0.7)",wN; wC; wCP; wMB
Productivity (PR),"“Is the house stable enough for people to work, recover, and stick around?” The long-term stability engine.",Baseline: Drive.
